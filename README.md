> Structured intelligence. Recursive power. Yours.

StruktAI is a local-first, voice-optional AI assistant system powered by plugin architecture, explainable actions, and builder-first design. Backed by the Baselisk daemon, it’s made for engineers, homelabbers, and rebels who want to own their AI.

⚙️ Coming soon: strukt-core, struktctl, baselisk-core, and more.
